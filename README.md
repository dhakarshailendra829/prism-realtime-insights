## Overview

**Modulus (Prism Realtime Insights)** is a real-time insight engine built to convert **fast, fragmented data streams** into **clear, continuously updated intelligence**.

Modern systems generate live data from applications, infrastructure, users, and services. Modulus unifies these signals into a **single, high-clarity dashboard**, enabling teams to understand system health, user behavior, and business performance in real time.

> **One screen. One source of truth. Real-time decisions.**
---

## Problem Statement

Organizations depend on multiple live data sources:

- Social media events  
- IoT and sensor streams  
- Application & infrastructure logs  
- Business and growth metrics  

These data streams:
- Arrive in **different formats**
- Update at **different speeds**
- Live across **separate tools and dashboards**

### The Impact
- Delayed issue detection  
- Partial or outdated decision-making  
- Heavy reliance on manual analysis and reports  
---

## Solution

Modulus acts as a **unified real-time analytics layer**.

It ingests heterogeneous data streams, standardizes them, applies lightweight analytics, and presents insights in a **clean, continuously updating UI** designed for rapid understanding and action.
